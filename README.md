# Window Waiting TO Be Usefull

This is a X window that display a bunch of labels which you can click to run
commands. It also displays the name of the root window so it works as statusline
with programs like slstatus.

That's all. It just sits there in your desktop waiting to be usefull.

Check out `config.h` and `Makefile` for more information.
